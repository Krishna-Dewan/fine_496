# Industry Return Forecasting Analysis - README

## Project Overview

This repository contains R code for analyzing the predictive power of macroeconomic factors on industry portfolio returns across different classification granularities (12, 17, 30, and 38 industries).

## Objective

**Goal:** To understand how well various macroeconomic factors can predict industry returns using:
- Different industry classification schemes (12/17/30/38 industries)
- Multiple time horizons (monthly/quarterly/annual)

## Current Implementation

### What's Working
- **Data Loading**: Successfully loads:
  - Macroeconomic factors data (`Bond_Return_Forecasting_Factors.csv`)
  - Industry returns for 4 classification schemes (12/17/30/38 industries)
  
- **Basic Analysis Framework**:
  - Implements in-sample regression analysis
  - Tests three different frequencies (monthly/quarterly/annual)
  - Uses consistent model specification across all tests:
    ```
    industry_return ~ factor1 + I(factor1^3) + factor2 + factor3 + factor4 + factor5 + factor9
    ```

### Current Capabilities
1. Data trimming to specified date range (2000-2010)
2. Basic regression analysis for each industry classification
3. Output of regression results showing factor significance

## Known Issues and Challenges

### Data Alignment Problems
1. **Date Handling**: 
   - Currently uses hard-coded row indices (`factors[2:529,]`) which may not generalize
   - Different industry datasets may have mismatched dates



### Code Structure Issues
1. **Redundant Operations**:
   - Multiple identical copies of factor data being created
   - Could be streamlined with better data structures

2. **Error Handling**:
   - No handling for missing data or incomplete cases
   - Stopifnot checks may be too strict

3. **Performance**:
   - Nested loops (frequency × granularity × industries) may be slow for large datasets
   - No parallel processing implemented

## Next Steps (Planned Improvements)

1. **Data Handling**:
   - Implement proper date parsing and alignment
   - Create unified data loading function
   - Add data validation checks

2. **Analysis Enhancements**:
   - Add out-of-sample testing framework
   - Implement rolling window regressions
   - Add performance metrics (MSE, R²)

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Refactor into functions for better reusability
   - Add proper error handling
   - Implement progress tracking

4. **Documentation**:
   - Add variable dictionary
   - Include sample output
   - Document expected file formats

## Usage Instructions

1. Place all data files in the `/data` directory
2. Run `industry_forecasting.R` in R/RStudio
3. Results will be printed to console

**Note:** Currently requires manual adjustment of file paths and may need modification of hard-coded row indices for different datasets.
